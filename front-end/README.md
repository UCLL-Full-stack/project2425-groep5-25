# Time Tracker Frontend

## Environment File Requirements

The frontend requires an environment file (.env) to configure the connection to the backend API and
other settings, such as frontend ports. Below are the necessary environment variables that need to
be set in the frontend .env file.

# Ports

API_PORT=<your_api_port> # The port on which the backend API is running.
FRONT_END_PORT=<your_front_end_port> # The port on which the frontend will run.
